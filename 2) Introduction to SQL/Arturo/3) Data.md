<h1>Data - Chapter three</h1>

When a table is created, a data type must be indicated for each field.

- The data type is chosen based on the type of data that the field will hold.
- Could be a number, text, date, etc.

Data types are used for several reasons:

- First different types of data are stored differently and take up different amount of storage space.
- Second, some operations only apply to certain data types. Example: multiply a number by other number, it does not make sense to multiply text by other text.

<h2> Data Types </h2> 

- Strings: A string refers to a sequence of characters such as letters or punctuation. SQL has several different types thath can hold strings like VARCHAR, VARCHAR is a data type that is more flexible and can store small or large strings, VARCHAR is very commonly used for storing strings.

- Integers: Store whole numbers, SQL offers a few different data types for storing integers, depending on how big the numbers are. INT is a common data type, can store numbers from less than negative two billion to more than positive two billion.

- Floats: Store numbers that include a fractional part, SQL also offers several float data types depending on how many digits the numbers in the field are expected to be. The NUMERIC data type can store floats, which have up to 38 digits total, including those before and after decimal point.

<h2> Schemas. </h2>

- Schemas are often referred to as "Blueprints" of databases.
- A schema shows a database design, such as what tables are included in the database and any relationshps between its tables.

<h2> Database storage</h2>

- The information we find in a database tables is physically stored on the hard disk of a server.
- Servers are centralized computers that perform  services via requests made over a network.
- In this case, the service perfomed is data access, but servers are also used to access websites or files stored on the server.
- Any computer can be a server if it is set up to provide a service, even a laptop.

Servers are generally very powerful and large machines, because they are best equipped to handle a high volume if requests and data.
